# How LangChain and RAG are used in this project

This app uses **LangChain** and a simple **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** module to enhance image analysis and feedback:

## LangChain
- LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by language models.
- In this project, LangChain is used with Google Gemini (via `@langchain/google-genai`) to generate creative image descriptions and process prompts.
- It can be extended to retrieve external data or provide more advanced, context-aware analysis in the future.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- RAG combines information retrieval with generative AI to provide richer, more relevant outputs.
- Here, the `simpleRAG.js` module simulates RAG by giving quick, random analysis tags for uploaded and generated images (e.g., "High visual appeal detected", "Trend-aware generation").
- This helps users understand what makes an image potentially viral, based on features detected or generated by the AI.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters a prompt → Gemini (via LangChain) generates a description and image.
2. User uploads an image → The app analyzes it using the RAG module.
3. Virality scores and RAG feedback are shown for both images.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
